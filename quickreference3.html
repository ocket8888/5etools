		<h2>Ability Checks</h2>
		<p>An ability check tests a character's or monster's innate talent and training in an effort to overcome a challenge. The DM calls for an ability check when a character or monster attempts an action (other than an attack) that has a chance of failure. When the outcome is uncertain, the dice determine the results.</p>
		<p>For every ability check, the DM decides which of the six abilities is relevant to the task at hand and the difficulty of the task, represented by a Difficulty Class. The more difficult a task, the higher its DC. The Typical Difficulty Classes table shows the most common DCs.</p>
		<table class="striped-odd">
			<caption>Typical Difficulty Classes</caption>
			<thead>
				<tr>
					<th>Task Difficulty</th>
					<th>DC</th>
				</tr>
			</thead>
			<tbody>
				<tr>
					<td>Very easy</td>
					<td>5</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Easy</td>
					<td>10</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Medium</td>
					<td>15</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Hard</td>
					<td>20</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Very hard</td>
					<td>25</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Nearly impossible</td>
					<td>30</td>
				</tr>
			</tbody>
		</table>

		<p>To make an ability check, roll a d20 and add the relevant ability modifier.</p>
		<p>As with other d20 rolls, apply bonuses and penalties, and compare the total to the DC. If the total equals or exceeds the DC, the ability check is a success—the creature overcomes the challenge at hand. Otherwise, it's a failure, which means the character or monster makes no progress toward the objective or makes progress combined with a setback determined by the DM.</p>

		<h3>Contests</h3>
		<p>Sometimes once character's or monster's efforts are directly opposed to another's. This can occur when both of them are trying to do the same thing and only one can succeed, such as attempting to snatch up a magic ring that has fallen to the floor. This situation also applies when one of them is trying to prevent the other one from accomplishing a goal—for example, when a monster tries to force open a door that an adventurer is holding closed. In situations like these, the outcome is determined by a special form of ability check, called a contest.</p>
		<p>Both participants in a contest make ability checks appropriate to their efforts. They apply all appropriate bonuses and penalties, but instead of comparing the total to a DC, they compare the totals of their two checks. The participant with the higher check total wins the contest. That character or monster either succeeds at the action or prevents the other one from succeeding.</p>
		<p>If the contest results in a tie, the situation remains the same as it was before the contest. Thus, one contestant might win the contest by default. If two characters tie in a contest to snatch a ring off the floor, neither character grabs it. In a contest between a monster trying to open a door and an adventurer trying to keep the door closed, a tie means that the door remains shut.</p>

		<h3>Passive Checks</h3>
		<p>A passive check is a special kind of ability check that doesn't involve any die rolls. Such a check can represent the average result for a task done repeatedly, such as searching for secret doors over and over again, or can be used when the DM wants to secretly determine whether the characters succeed at something without rolling dice, such as noticing a hidden monster.</p>
		<p>Here's how to determine a character's total for a passive check:</p>

		<blockquote>
			<math>
				<mn>10</mn><mo>+</mo><mi>all modifiers that normally apply to the check</mi>
			</math>
		</blockquote>

		<p>If the character has advantage on the check, add 5. For disadvantage, subtract 5. The game refers to a passive check total as a score.</p>
		<p>For example, if a 1st-level character has a Wisdom of 15 and proficiency in Perception, he or she has a passive Wisdom (Perception) score of 14.</p>
		<p>The rules on hiding in the "Dexterity" section below rely on passive checks, as do the exploration rules in chapter 8.</p>

		<hr/>

		<h3>Working Together</h3>
		<p>Sometimes two or more characters team up to attempt a task. The character who's leading the effort—or the one with the highest ability modifier—can make an ability check with advantage, reflecting the help provided by the other characters. In combat, this requires the Help action (see chapter 9).</p>
		<p>A character can only provide help if the task is one that he or she could attempt alone. For example, trying to open a lock requires proficiency with thieves' tools, so a character who lacks that proficiency can't help another character in that task. Moreover, a character can help only when two or more individuals working together would actually be productive. Some tasks, such as threading a needle, are no easier with help.</p>

		<h4>Group Checks</h4>
		<p>When a number of individuals are trying to accomplish something as a group, the DM might ask for a group ability check. In such a situation, the characters who are skilled at a particular task help cover those who aren't.</p>
		<p>To make a group ability check, everyone in the group makes the ability check. If at least half the group succeeds, the whole group succeeds. Otherwise, the group fails.</p>
		<p>Group checks don't come up very often, and they're most useful when all the characters succeed or fail as a group. For example, when adventurers are navigating a swamp, the DM might call for a group Wisdom (Survival) check to see if the characters can avoid the quicksand, sinkholes, and other natural hazards of the environment. If at least half the group succeeds, the successful characters are able to guide their companions out of danger. Otherwise, the group stumbles into one of these hazards.</p>

	<section id="scoresandmodifiers">
		<h2>Ability Scores and Modifiers</h2>
		<p>Each of a creature's abilities has a score, a number that defines the magnitude of that ability. An ability score is not just a measure of innate capabilities, but also encompasses a creature's training and competence in activities related to that ability.</p>
		<p>A score of 10 or 11 is the normal human average, but adventurers and many monsters are a cut above average in most abilities. A score of 18 is the highest that a person usually reaches. Adventurers can have scores as high as 20, and monsters and divine beings can have scores as high as 30.</p>
		<p>Each ability also has a modifier, derived from the score and ranging from -5 (for an ability score of 1) to +10 (for a score of 30). The Ability Scores and Modifiers table notes the ability modifiers for the range of possible ability scores, from 1 to 30.</p>
		<p>To determine an ability modifier without consulting the table, subtract 10 from the ability score and then divide the total by 2 (round down).</p>
		<p>Because ability modifiers affect almost every attack roll, ability check, and saving throw, ability modifiers come up in play more often than their associated scores.</p>

	<section id="advantages">
		<h2>Advantage and Disadvantage</h2>
		<p>Sometimes a special ability or spell tells you that you have advantage or disadvantage on an ability check, a saving throw, or an attack roll. When that happens, you roll a second d20 when you make the roll. Use the higher of the two rolls if you have advantage, and use the lower roll if you have disadvantage. For example, if you have disadvantage and roll a 17 and a 5, you use the 5. If you instead have advantage and roll those numbers, you use the 17.</p>
		<p>If multiple situations affect a roll and each one grants advantage or imposes disadvantage on it, you don't roll more than one additional d20. If two favorable situations grant advantage, for example, you still roll only one additional d20.</p>
		<p>If circumstances cause a roll to have both advantage and disadvantage, you are considered to have neither of them, and you roll one d20. This is true even if multiple circumstances impose disadvantage and only one grants advantage or vice versa. In such a situation, you have neither advantage nor disadvantage.</p>
		<p>When you have advantage or disadvantage and something in the game, such as the halfling's Lucky trait, lets you reroll the d20, you can reroll only one of the dice. You choose which one. For example, if a halfling has advantage on an ability check and rolls a 1 and a 13, the halfling could use the Lucky trait to reroll the 1.</p>
		<p>You usually gain advantage or disadvantage through the use of special abilities, actions, or spells. Inspiration (see chapter 4) can also give a character advantage on checks related to the character's personality, ideals, or bonds. The DM can also decide that circumstances influence a roll in one direction or the other and grant advantage or impose disadvantage as a result.</p>

	<section id="casting">
		<h2>Casting a Spell</h2>
		<p>When a character casts any spell, the same basic rules are followed, regardless of the character's class or the spell's effects.</p>
		<p>Each spell description in chapter 11 begins with a block of information, including the spell's name, level, school of magic, casting time, range, components, and duration. The rest of a spell entry describes the spell's effect.</p>

		<h3>Casting in Armor</h3>
		<p>Because of the mental focus and precise gestures required for spellcasting, you must be proficient with the armor you are wearing to cast a spell. You are otherwise too distracted and physically hampered by your armor for spellcasting.</p>

		<hr/>

		<h3>Casting Time</h3>
		<p>Most spells require a single action to cast, but some spells require a bonus action, a reaction, or much more time to cast.</p>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Bonus Action</strong> - A spell cast with a bonus action is especially swift. You must use a bonus action on your turn to cast the spell, provided that you haven't already taken a bonus action this turn. You can't cast another spell during the same turn, except for a cantrip with a casting time of 1 action.</li>

			<li><strong>Reactions</strong> - Some spells can be cast as reactions. These spells take a fraction of a second to bring about and are cast in response to some event. If a spell can be cast as a reaction, the spell description tells you exactly when you can do so.</li>

			<li><strong>Longer Casting Times</strong> - Certain spells (including spells cast as rituals) require more time to cast: minutes or even hours. When you cast a spell with a casting time longer than a single action or reaction, you must spend your action each turn casting the spell, and you must maintain your concentration while you do so (see "Concentration" below). If your concentration is broken, the spell fails, but you don't expend a spell slot. If you want to try casting the spell again, you must start over.</li>
		</ul>

		<hr/>

		<h3>Range</h3>
		<p>The target of a spell must be within the spell's range. For a spell like magic missile, the target is a creature. For a spell like fireball, the target is the point in space where the ball of fire erupts.</p>
		<p>Most spells have ranges expressed in feet. Some spells can target only a creature (including you) that you touch. Other spells, such as the shield spell, affect only you. These spells have a range of self.</p>
		<p>Spells that create cones or lines of effect that originate from you also have a range of self, indicating that the origin point of the spell's effect must be you (see "Areas of Effect" later in the this chapter).</p>
		<p>Once a spell is cast, its effects aren't limited by its range, unless the spell's description says otherwise.</p>

		<hr/>

		<h3>Components</h3>
		<p>A spell's components are the physical requirements you must meet in order to cast it. Each spell's description indicates whether it requires verbal (V), somatic (S), or material (M) components. If you can't provide one or more of a spell's components, you are unable to cast the spell.</p>

		<ul>
			<li><strong>Verbal (V)</strong> - Most spells require the chanting of mystic words. The words themselves aren't the source of the spell's power; rather, the particular combination of sounds, with specific pitch and resonance, sets the threads of magic in motion. Thus, a character who is gagged or in an area of silence, such as one created by the silence spell, can't cast a spell with a verbal component.</li>

			<li><strong>Somatic (S)</strong> - Spellcasting gestures might include a forceful gesticulation or an intricate set of gestures. If a spell requires a somatic component, the caster must have free use of at least one hand to perform these gestures.</li>

			<li><strong>Material (M)</strong> - Casting some spells requires particular objects, specified in parentheses in the component entry. A character can use a component pouch or a spellcasting focus (found in chapter 5) in place of the components specified for a spell. But if a cost is indicated for a component, a character must have that specific component before he or she can cast the spell. If a spell states that a material component is consumed by the spell, the caster must provide this component for each casting of the spell. A spellcaster must have a hand free to access these components, but it can be the same hand that he or she uses to perform somatic components.</li>
		</ul>

		<hr/>

		<h3>Duration</h3>
		<p>A spell's duration is the length of time the spell persists. A duration can be expressed in rounds, minutes, hours, or even years. Some spells specify that their effects last until the spells are dispelled or destroyed.</p>
		<ul>

			<li><strong>Instantaneous</strong> - Many spells are instantaneous. The spell harms, heals, creates, or alters a creature or an object in a way that can't be dispelled, because its magic exists only for an instant.</li>

			<li><strong>Concentration</strong> - Some spells require you to maintain concentration in order to keep their magic active. If you lose concentration, such a spell ends. If a spell must be maintained with concentration, that fact appears in its Duration entry, and the spell specifies how long you can concentrate on it. You can end concentration at any time (no action required). Normal activity, such as moving and attacking, doesn't interfere with concentration. The following factors can break concentration:
				<ul>
					<li><em>Casting another spell that requires concentration</em> You lose concentration on a spell if you cast another spell that requires concentration. You can't concentrate on two spells at once.</li>
					<li><em>Taking damage</em> Whenever you take damage while you are concentrating on a spell, you must make a Constitution saving throw to maintain your concentration. The DC equals 10 or half the damage you take, whichever number is higher. If you take damage from multiple sources, such as an arrow and a dragon's breath, you make a separate saving throw for each source of damage.</li>
					<li><em>Being incapacitated or killed</em> You lose concentration on a spell if you are incapacitated or if you die.</li>
				</ul>
			The DM might also decide that certain environmental phenomena, such as a wave crashing over you while you're on a storm-tossed ship, require you to succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw to maintain concentration on a spell.</li>
		</ul>

		<hr/>

		<h3>Targets</h3>
		<p>A typical spell requires you to pick one or more targets to be affected by the spell's magic. A spell's description tells you whether the spell targets creatures, objects, or a point of origin for an area of effect (described below).</p>
		<p>Unless a spell has a perceptible effect, a creature might not know it was targeted by a spell at all. An effect like crackling lightning is obvious, but a more subtle effect, such as an attempt to read a creature's thoughts, typically goes unnoticed, unless a spell says otherwise.</p>

		<h4>A Clear Path to the Target</h4>
		<p>To target something, you must have a clear path to it, so it can't be behind total cover.</p>
		<p>If you place an area of effect at a point that you can't see and an obstruction, such as a wall, is between you and that point, the point of origin comes into being on the near side of that obstruction.</p>

		<h4>Targeting Yourself</h4>
		<p>If a spell targets a creature of your choice, you can choose yourself, unless the creature must be hostile or specifically a creature other than you. If you are in the area of effect of a spell you cast, you can target yourself.</p>

		<hr/>

		<h3>The Schools of Magic</h3>
		<dl>
			<dt>Abjuration</dt> <dd>spells are protective in nature, though some of them have aggressive uses. They create magical barriers, negate harmful effects, harm trespassers, or banish creatures to other planes of existence.</dd>
			<dt>Conjuration</dt> <dd>spells involve the transportation of objects and creatures from one location to another. Some spells summon creatures or objects to the caster's side, whereas others allow the caster to teleport to another location. Some conjurations create objects or effects out of nothing.</dd>
			<dt>Divination</dt> <dd>spells reveal information, whether in the form of secrets long forgotten, glimpses of the future, the locations of hidden things, the truth behind illusions, or visions of distant people or places.</dd>
			<dt>Enchantment</dt> <dd>spells affect the minds of others, influencing or controlling their behavior. Such spells can make enemies see the caster as a friend, force creatures to take a course of action, or even control another creature like a puppet.</dd>
			<dt>Evocation</dt> <dd>spells manipulate magical energy to produce a desired effect. Some call up blasts of fire or lightning. Others channel positive energy to heal wounds.</dd>
			<dt>Illusion</dt> <dd>spells deceive the senses or minds of others. They cause people to see things that are not there, to miss things that are there, to hear phantom noises, or to remember things that never happened. Some illusions create phantom images that any creature can see, but the most insidious illusions plant an image directly in the mind of a creature.</dd>
			<dt>Necromancy</dt> <dd>spells manipulate the energies of life and death. Such spells can grant an extra reserve of life force, drain the life energy from another creature, create the undead, or even bring the dead back to life. Creating the undead through the use of <dfn>Necromancy</dfn> spells such as animate dead is not a good act, and only evil casters use such spells frequently.</dd>
			<dt>Transmutation</dt> <dd>spells change the properties of a creature, object, or environment. They might turn an enemy into a harmless creature, bolster the strength of an ally, make an object move at the caster's command, or enhance a creature's innate healing abilities to rapidly recover from injury.</dd>

		<h3>Areas of Effect</h3>
		<p>Spells such as burning hands and cone of cold cover an area, allowing them to affect multiple creatures at once. A spell's description specifies its area of effect, which typically has one of five different shapes: cone, cube, cylinder, line, or sphere. Every area of effect has a point of origin, a location from which the spell's energy erupts. The rules for each shape specify how you position its point of origin. Typically, a point of origin is a point in space, but some spells have an area whose origin is a creature or an object.</p>
		<p>A spell's effect expands in straight lines from the point of origin. If no unblocked straight line extends from the point of origin to a location within the area of effect, that location isn't included in the spell's area. To block one of these imaginary lines, an obstruction must provide total cover, as explained in chapter 9.</p>

		<img src="img/rules/Point-of-Origin.png" alt="Point of Origin Visual Aid" />

		<dl>
			<dt>Cone</dt>
			<dd>A <dfn>cone</dfn> extends in a direction you choose from its point of origin. A <dfn>cone</dfn>'s width at a given point along its length is equal to that point's distance from the point of origin. A <dfn>cone</dfn>'s area of effect specifies its maximum length. A <dfn>cone</dfn>'s point of origin is not included in the <dfn>cone</dfn>'s area of effect, unless you decide otherwise.</dd>

			<dt>Cube</dt>
			<dd>You select a <dfn>cube</dfn>'s point of origin, which lies anywhere on a face of the cubic effect. The <dfn>cube</dfn>'s size is expressed as the length of each side. A <dfn>cube</dfn>'s point of origin is not included in the cube's area of effect, unless you decide otherwise.</dd>

			<dt>Cylinder</dt>
			<dd>A <dfn>cylinder</dfn>'s point of origin is the center of a circle of a particular radius, as given in the spell description. The circle must either be on the ground or at the height of the spell effect. The energy in a <dfn>cylinder</dfn> expands in straight lines from the point of origin to the perimeter of the circle, forming the base of the <dfn>cylinder</dfn>. The spell's effect then shoots up from the base or down from the top, to a distance equal to the height of the <dfn>cylinder</dfn>. A cylinder's point of origin is included in the cylinder's area of effect.</dd>

			<dt>Line</dt>
			<dd>A <dfn>line</dfn> extends from its point of origin in a straight path up to its length and covers an area defined by its width. A <dfn>line</dfn>'s point of origin is not included in the <dfn>line</dfn>'s area of effect, unless you decide otherwise.</dd>

			<dt>Sphere</dt>
			<dd>You select a <dfn>sphere</dfn>'s point of origin, and the <dfn>sphere</dfn> extends outward from that point. The <dfn>sphere</dfn>'s size is expressed as a radius in feet that extends from the point. A <dfn>sphere</dfn>'s point of origin is included in the sphere's area of effect.</dd>
		</dl>

		<h3>Combining Magical Effects</h3>
		<p>The effects of different spells add together while the durations of those spells overlap. The effects of the same spell cast multiple times don't combine, however. Instead, the most potent effect—such as the highest bonus—from those castings applies while their durations overlap.</p>
		<p>For example, if two clerics cast bless on the same target, that character gains the spell's benefit only once; he or she doesn't get to roll two bonus dice.</p>

		<hr/>

		<h3>The Weave of Magic</h3>
		<p>The worlds within the D&amp;D multiverse are magical places. All existence is suffused with magical power, and potential energy lies untapped in every rock, stream, and living creature, the mute and mindless will of existence, permeating every bit of matter and present in every manifestation of energy throughout the multiverse.</p>
		<p>Mortals can't directly shape this raw magic. Instead, they make use of a fabric of magic, a kind of interface between the will of a spellcaster and the stuff of raw magic. The spellcasters of the Forgotten Realms call it the Weave and recognize its essence as the goddess Mystra, but casters have varied ways of naming and visualizing this interface.</p>
		<p>By any name, without the Weave, raw magic is locked away and inaccessible; the most powerful archmage can't light a candle with magic in an area where the Weave has been torn. But surrounded by the Weave, a spellcaster can shape lightning to blast foes, transport hundreds of miles in the blink of an eye, or even reverse death itself.</p>
		<p>All magic depends on the Weave, though different kinds of magic access it in a variety of ways. The spells of wizards, warlocks, sorcerers, and bards are commonly called <b>arcane magic</b>. These spells rely on an understanding—learned or intuitive—of the workings of the Weave. The caster plucks directly at the strands of the Weave to create the desired effect. Eldritch knights and arcane tricksters also use arcane magic. The spells of clerics, druids, paladins, and rangers are called <b>divine magic</b>. These spellcasters' access to the Weave is mediated by divine power—gods, the divine forces of nature, or the sacred weight of a paladin's oath.</p>
		<p>Whenever a magic effect is created, the threads of the Weave intertwine, twist, and fold to make the effect possible.</p>
		<p>When characters use divination spells such as <i>Detect Magic</i> or <i>Identify</i>, they glimpse the Weave. A spell such as <i>Dispel Magic</i> smooths the Weave. Spells such as <i>Antimagic Field</i> rearrange the Weave so that magic flows around, rather than through the area affected by the spell. And in places where the Weave is damaged or torn, magic works in unpredictable ways—or not at all.</p>

		<h2>Conditions</h2>
		<p>Conditions alter a creature's capabilities in a variety of ways and can arise as a result of a spell, a class feature, a monster's attack, or other effect. Most conditions, such as blinded, are impairments, but a few, such as invisible, can be advantageous.</p>
		<p>A condition lasts either until it is countered (the prone condition is countered by standing up, for example) or for a duration specified by the effect that imposed the condition.</p>
		<p>If multiple effects impose the same condition on a creature, each instance of the condition has its own duration, but the condition's effects don't get worse. A creature either has a condition or doesn't.</p>

		<h2>Falling</h2>
		<p>A fall from a great height is one of the most common hazards facing an adventurer.</p>
		<p>At the end of a fall, a creature takes 1d6 bludgeoning damage for every 10 feet it fell, to a maximum of 20d6. The creature lands prone, unless it avoids taking damage from the fall.</p>

		<h2>Food and Water</h2>
		<p>Characters who don't eat or drink suffer the effects of exhaustion (see the appendix). Exhaustion caused by lack of food or water can't be removed until the character eats and drinks the full required amount.</p>

		<h3>Food</h3>
		<p>A character needs one pound of food per day and can make food last longer by subsisting on half rations. Eating half a pound of food in a day counts as half a day without food.</p>
		<p>A character can go without food for a number of days equal to 3 + his or her Constitution modifier (minimum 1). At the end of each day beyond that limit, a character automatically suffers one level of exhaustion.</p>
		<p>A normal day of eating resets the count of days without food to zero.</p>

		<hr/>

		<h3>Water</h3>
		<p>A character needs one gallon of water per day, or two gallons per day if the weather is hot. A character who drinks only half that much water must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or suffer one level of exhaustion at the end of the day. A character with access to even less water automatically suffers one level of exhaustion at the end of the day.</p>
		<p>If the character already has one or more levels of exhaustion, the character takes two levels in either case.</p>

	<section id="how">
		<h2>How to Play</h2>
		<ol>
			<li><strong>The DM describes the environment</strong><br/>
			The DM tells the players where their adventurers are and what's around them, presenting the basic scope of options that present themselves (how many doors lead out of a room, what's on a table, who's in the tavern, and so on).</li>

			<li><strong>The players describe what they want to do</strong><br/>
			Sometimes one player speaks for the whole party, saying, "We'll take the east door," for example. Other times, different adventurers do different things: one adventurer might search a treasure chest while a second examines an esoteric symbol engraved on a wall and a third keeps watch for monsters. The players don't need to take turns, but the DM listens to every player and decides how to resolve those actions.<br/>
			Sometimes, resolving a task is easy. If an adventurer wants to walk across a room and open a door, the DM might just say that the door opens and describe what lies beyond. But the door might be locked, the floor might hide a deadly trap, or some other circumstance might make it challenging for an adventurer to complete a task. In those cases, the DM decides what happens, often relying on the roll of a die to determine the results of an action.</li>

			<li><strong>The DM narrates the results of the adventurers' actions</strong><br/>
			Describing the results often leads to another decision point, which brings the flow of the game right back to step 1.</li>
		</ol>

		<p>This pattern holds whether the adventurers are cautiously exploring a ruin, talking to a devious prince, or locked in mortal combat against a mighty dragon.</p>
		<p>In certain situations, particularly combat, the action is more structured and the players (and DM) do take turns choosing and resolving actions. But most of the time, play is fluid and flexible, adapting to the circumstances of the adventure.</p>
		<p>Often the action of an adventure takes place in the imagination of the players and DM, relying on the DM's verbal descriptions to set the scene. Some DMs like to use music, art, or recorded sound effects to help set the mood, and many players and DMs alike adopt different voices for the various adventurers, monsters, and other characters they play in the game. Sometimes, a DM might lay out a map and use tokens or miniature figures to represent each creature involved in a scene to help the players keep track of where everyone is.</p>

		<hr/>

		<h3>Game Dice</h3>
		<p>The game uses polyhedral dice with different numbers of sides. You can find dice like these in game stores and in many bookstores.</p>
		<p>In these rules, the different dice are referred to by the letter <q>d</q> followed by the number of sides - d4, d6, d8, d10, d12, and d20. For instance, a d6 is a six-sided die (the typical cube that many games use).</p>
		<p>Percentile dice, or d100, work a little differently. You generate a number between 1 and 100 by rolling two different ten-sided dice numbered from 0 to 9.</p>
		<p>One die (designated before you roll) gives the tens digit, and the other gives the ones digit. If you roll a 7 and a 1, for example, the number rolled is 71. Two 0s represent 100. Some ten-sided dice are numbered in tens (00, 10, 20, and so on), making it easier to distinguish the tens digit from the ones digit. In this case, a roll of 70 and 1 is 71, and 00 and 0 is 100.</p>
		<p>When you need to roll dice, the rules tell you how many dice to roll of a certain type, as well as what modifiers to add. For example, "3d8 + 5" means you roll three eight-sided dice, add them together, and add 5 to the total.</p>
		<p>The same d notation appears in the expressions "1d3" and "1d2." To simulate the roll of 1d3, roll a d6 and divide the number rolled by 2 (round up). To simulate the roll of 1d2, roll any die and assign a 1 or 2 to the roll depending on whether it was odd or even. (Alternatively, if the number rolled is more than half the number of sides on the die, it's a 2.)</p>

		<h4>The D20</h4>
		<p>Does an adventurer's sword swing hurt a dragon or just bounce off its iron-hard scales? Will the ogre believe an outrageous bluff? Can a character swim across a raging river? Can a character avoid the main blast of a fireball, or does he or she take full damage from the blaze? In cases where the outcome of an action is uncertain, the Dungeons &amp; Dragons game relies on rolls of a 20-sided die, a d20, to determine success or failure.</p>
		<p>Every character and monster in the game has capabilities defined by six <b>ability scores</b>. The abilities are Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma, and they typically range from 3 to 18 for most adventurers. (Monsters might have scores as low as 1 or as high as 30.) These ability scores, and the ability modifiers derived from them, are the basis for almost every d20 roll that a player makes on a character's or monster's behalf.</p>
		<p>Ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws are the three main kinds of d20 rolls, forming the core of the rules of the game. All three follow these simple steps.</p>
		<ol>
			<li><strong>Roll the die and add a modifier</strong><br/>
			Roll a d20 and add the relevant modifier. This is typically the modifier derived from one of the six ability scores, and it sometimes includes a proficiency bonus to reflect a character's particular skill. (See chapter 1 for details on each ability and how to determine an ability's modifier.)</li>

			<li><strong>Apply circumstantial bonuses and penalties</strong><br/>
			A class feature, a spell, a particular circumstance, or some other effect might give a bonus or penalty to the check.</li>

			<li><strong>Compare the total to a target number</strong><br/>
			If the total equals or exceeds the target number, the ability check, attack roll, or saving throw is a success. Otherwise, it's a failure. The DM is usually the one who determines target numbers and tells players whether their ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws succeed or fail. The target number for an ability check or a saving throw is called a <dfn><abbr title="Difficulty Class">DC</abbr></dfn>. The target number for an attack roll is called an <dfn><abbr title="Armor Class">AC</abbr></dfn>.</li>
		</ol>

		<p>This simple rule governs the resolution of most tasks in D&amp;D play. Chapter 7 provides more detailed rules for using the d20 in the game.</p>

		<hr/>

		<h3>Advantage and Disadvantage</h3>
		<p>Sometimes an ability check, attack roll, or saving throw is modified by special situations called advantage and disadvantage. Advantage reflects the positive circumstances surrounding a d20 roll, while disadvantage reflects the opposite. When you have either advantage or disadvantage, you roll a second d20 when you make the roll. Use the higher of the two rolls if you have advantage, and use the lower roll if you have disadvantage. For example, if you have disadvantage and roll a 17 and a 5, you use the 5. If you instead have advantage and roll those numbers, you use the 17.</p>
		<p>More detailed rules for advantage and disadvantage are presented in chapter 7.</p>

		<hr/>

		<h3>Specific Beats General</h3>
		<p>This book contains rules, especially in parts 2 and 3, that govern how the game plays. That said, many racial traits, class features, spells, magic items, monster abilities, and other game elements break the general rules in some way, creating an exception to how the rest of the game works. Remember this: If a specific rule contradicts a general rule, the specific rule wins.</p>
		<p>Exceptions to the rules are often minor. For instance, many adventurers don't have proficiency with longbows, but every wood elf does because of a racial trait. That trait creates a minor exception in the game. Other examples of rule-breaking are more conspicuous. For instance, an adventurer can't normally pass through walls, but some spells make that possible. Magic accounts for most of the major exceptions to the rules.</p>
		<aside>
			<b>Round Down</b><br/>
			<p>There's one more general rule you need to know at the outset. Whenever you divide a number in the game, round down if you end up with a fraction, even if the fraction is one-half or greater.</p>

	<section id="adventures">
		<h2>Adventures</h2>
		<p>The Dungeons &amp; Dragons game consists of a group of characters embarking on an adventure that the Dungeon Master presents to them. Each character brings particular capabilities to the adventure in the form of ability scores and skills, class features, racial traits, equipment, and magic items. Every character is different, with various strengths and weaknesses, so the best party of adventurers is one in which the characters complement each other and cover the weaknesses of their companions. The adventurers must cooperate to successfully complete the adventure.</p>
		<p>The adventure is the heart of the game, a story with a beginning, a middle, and an end. An adventure might be created by the Dungeon Master or purchased off the shelf, tweaked and modified to suit the DM's needs and desires. In either case, an adventure features a fantastic setting, whether it's an underground dungeon, a crumbling castle, a stretch of wilderness, or a bustling city. It features a rich cast of characters: the adventurers created and played by the other players at the table, as well as nonplayer characters (NPCs). Those characters might be patrons, allies, enemies, hirelings, or just background extras in an adventure. Often, one of the NPCs is a villain whose agenda drives much of an adventure's action.</p>
		<p>Over the course of their adventures, the characters are confronted by a variety of creatures, objects, and situations that they must deal with in some way. Sometimes the adventurers and other creatures do their best to kill or capture each other in combat. At other times, the adventurers talk to another creature (or even a magical object) with a goal in mind. And often, the adventurers spend time trying to solve a puzzle, bypass an obstacle, find something hidden, or unravel the current situation. Meanwhile, the adventurers explore the world, making decisions about which way to travel and what they'll try to do next.</p>
		<p>Adventures vary in length and complexity. A short adventure might present only a few challenges, and it might take no more than a single game session to complete. A long adventure can involve hundreds of combats, interactions, and other challenges, and take dozens of sessions to play through, stretching over weeks or months of real time. Usually, the end of an adventure is marked by the adventurers heading back to civilization to rest and enjoy the spoils of their labors.</p>
		<p>But that's not the end of the story. You can think of an adventure as a single episode of a TV series, made up of multiple exciting scenes. A campaign is the whole series—a string of adventures joined together, with a consistent group of adventurers following the narrative from start to finish.</p>

		<h3>The Three Pillars of Adventure</h3>
		<p>Adventurers can try to do anything their players can imagine, but it can be helpful to talk about their activities in three broad categories: exploration, social interaction, and combat.</p>
		<dl>
			<dt>Exploration</dt>
			<dd>includes both the adventurers' movement through the world and their interaction with objects and situations that require their attention. <dfn>Exploration</dfn> is the give-and-take of the players describing what they want their characters to do, and the Dungeon Master telling the players what happens as a result. On a large scale, that might involve the characters spending a day crossing a rolling plain or an hour making their way through caverns underground. On the smallest scale, it could mean one character pulling a lever in a dungeon room to see what happens.</dd>

			<dt>Social-interaction</dt>
			<dd>features the adventurers talking to someone (or something) else. It might mean demanding that a captured scout reveal the secret entrance to the goblin lair, getting information from a rescued prisoner, pleading for mercy from an orc chieftain, or persuading a talkative magic mirror to show a distant location to the adventurers. The rules in chapters 7 and 8 support exploration and social interaction, as do many class features in chapter 3 and personality traits in chapter 4.</dd>

			<dt>Combat</dt>
			<dd>the focus of chapter 9, involves characters and other creatures swinging weapons, casting spells, maneuvering for position, and so on-all in an effort to defeat their opponents, whether that means killing every enemy, taking captives, or forcing a rout. <dfn>Combat</dfn> is the most structured element of a D&amp;D session, with creatures taking turns to make sure that everyone gets a chance to act. Even in the context of a pitched battle, there's still plenty of opportunity for adventurers to attempt wacky stunts like surfing down a flight of stairs on a shield, to examine the environment (perhaps by pulling a mysterious lever), and to interact with other creatures, including allies, enemies, and neutral parties.</dd>
		</dl>

		<hr/>

		<h3>The Wonders of Magic</h3>
		<p>Few D&amp;D adventures end without something magical happening. Whether helpful or harmful, magic appears frequently in the life of an adventurer, and it is the focus of chapters 10 and 11.</p>
		<p>In the worlds of Dungeons &amp; Dragons, practitioners of magic are rare, set apart from the masses of people by their extraordinary talent. Common folk might see evidence of magic on a regular basis, but it's usually minor—a fantastic monster, a visibly answered prayer, a wizard walking through the streets with an animated shield guardian as a bodyguard.</p>
		<p>For adventurers, though, magic is key to their survival. Without the healing magic of clerics and paladins, adventurers would quickly succumb to their wounds. Without the uplifting magical support of bards and clerics, warriors might be overwhelmed by powerful foes. Without the sheer magical power and versatility of wizards and druids, every threat would be magnified tenfold.</p>
		<p>Magic is also a favored tool of villains. Many adventures are driven by the machinations of spellcasters who are hellbent on using magic for some ill end. A cult leader seeks to awaken a god who slumbers beneath the sea, a hag kidnaps youths to magically drain them of their vigor, a mad wizard labors to invest an army of automatons with a facsimile of life, a dragon begins a mystical ritual to rise up as a god of destruction—these are just a few of the magical threats that adventurers might face. With magic of their own, in the form of spells and magic items, the adventurers might prevail!</p>
	</section>

	<hr class="section-break">

	<section id="interacting">
		<h2>Interacting with Objects</h2>
		<p>A character's interaction with objects in an environment is often simple to resolve in the game. The player tells the <abbr title="Dungeon Master">DM</abbr> that his or her character is doing something, such a moving a lever, and the <abbr title="Dungeon Master">DM</abbr> describes what, if anything happens.</p>
		<p>For example, a character might decide to pull a lever, which might, in turn, raise a portcullis, cause a room to flood with water, or open a secret door in a nearby wall. If the lever is rusted in position, though, a character might need to force it. In such a situation, the DM might call for a Strength check to see whether the character can wrench the lever into place. The DM sets the DC for any such check based on the difficulty of the task.</p>
		<p>Characters can also damage objects with their weapons and spells. Objects are immune to poison and psychic damage, but otherwise they can be affected by physical and magical attacks much like creatures can. The DM determines an object's Armor Class and hit points, and might decide that certain objects have resistance or immunity to certain kinds of attacks. (It's hard to cut a rope with a club, for example.) Objects always fail Strength and Dexterity saving throws, and they are immune to effects that require other saves.</p>
		<p>When an object drops to 0 hit points, it breaks.</p>
		<p>A character can also attempt a Strength check to break an object. The <abbr title="Dungeon Master">DM</abbr> sets the <abbr title="Difficulty Class">DC</abbr> for any such check.</p>
	</section>

	<hr class="section-break">

	<section id="proficiency">
		<h2>Proficiency Bonus</h2>
		<p>Characters have a proficiency bonus determined by level, as detailed in chapter 1. Monsters also have this bonus, which is incorporated in their stat blocks. The bonus is used in the rules on ability checks, saving throws, and attack rolls.</p>
		<p>Your proficiency bonus can't be added to a single die roll or other number more than once. For example, if two different rules say you can add your proficiency bonus to a Wisdom saving throw, you nevertheless add the bonus only once when you make the save.</p>
		<p>Occasionally, your proficiency bonus might be multiplied or divided (doubled or halved, for example) before you apply it. For example, the rogue's Expertise feature doubles the proficiency bonus for certain ability checks. If a circumstance suggests that your proficiency bonus applies more than once to the same roll, you still add it only once and multiply or divide it only once.</p>
		<p>By the same token, if a feature or effect allows you to multiply your proficiency bonus when making an ability check that wouldn't normally benefit from your proficiency bonus, you still don't add the bonus to the check. For that check your proficiency bonus is 0, given the fact that multiplying 0 by any number is still 0. For instance, if you lack proficiency in the History skill, you gain no benefit from a feature that lets you double your proficiency bonus when you make Intelligence (History) checks.</p>
		<p>In general, you don't multiply your proficiency bonus for attack rolls or saving throws. If a feature or effect allows you to do so, these same rules apply.</p>
	</section>

	<hr class="section-break">

	<section id="resting">
		<h2>Resting</h2>
		<p>Heroic though they might be, adventurers can't spend every hour of the day in the thick of exploration, social interaction, and combat. They need rest-time to sleep and eat, tend their wounds, refresh their minds and spirits for spellcasting, and brace themselves for further adventure.</p>
		<p>Adventurers, and creatures, can take short rests in the midst of an adventuring day and a long rest to end the day.</p>
		<dl>
			<dt>Short Rest</dt>
			<dd>A short rest is a period of downtime, at least 1 hour long, during which a character does nothing more strenuous than eating, drinking, reading, and tending to wounds. A character can spend one or more Hit Dice at the end of a short rest, up to the character's maximum number of Hit Dice, which is equal to the character's level. For each Hit Die spent in this way, the player rolls the die and adds the character's Constitution modifier to it. The character regains hit points equal to the total. After applying your Constitution modifier to a Hit Die roll, you regain a minimum of 0 hit points. The player can decide to spend an additional Hit Die after each roll. A character regains some spent Hit Dice upon finishing a long rest, as explained below.</dd>

			<dt>Long Rest</dt>
			<dd>A long rest is a period of extended downtime, at least 8 hours long, during which a character sleeps or performs light activity: reading, talking, eating, or standing watch for no more than 2 hours. If the rest is interrupted by a period of strenuous activity—at least 1 hour of walking, fighting, casting spells, or similar adventuring activity, the characters must begin the rest again to gain any benefit from it. At the end of a long rest, a character regains all lost hit points. The character also regains spent Hit Dice, up to a number of dice equal to half of the character's total number of them. You regain at least 1 Hit Die when you finish a long rest. For example, if a character has eight Hit Dice, he or she can regain four spent Hit Dice upon finishing a long rest. A character can't benefit from more than one long rest in a 24-hour period, and a character must have at least 1 hit point at the start of the rest to gain its benefits.</dd>
		</dl>
	</section>

	<hr class="section-break">

	<section id="saving">
		<h2>Saving Throws</h2>
		<p>A saving throw—also called a save—represents an attempt to resist a spell, a trap, a poison, a disease, or a similar threat. You don't normally decide to make a saving throw; you are forced to make one because your character or monster is at risk of harm.</p>
		<p>To make a saving throw, roll a d20 and add the appropriate ability modifier. For example, you use your Dexterity modifier for a Dexterity saving throw.</p>
		<p>A saving throw can be modified by a situational bonus or penalty and can be affected by advantage and disadvantage, as determined by the DM.</p>
		<p>Each class gives proficiency in at least two saving throws. The wizard, for example, is proficient in Intelligence saves. As with skill proficiencies, proficiency in a saving throw lets a character add his or her proficiency bonus to saving throws made using a particular ability score. Some monsters have saving throw proficiencies as well.</p>
		<p>The Difficulty Class for a saving throw is determined by the effect that causes it. For example, the DC for a saving throw allowed by a spell is determined by the caster's spellcasting ability and proficiency bonus.</p>
		<p>The result of a successful or failed saving throw is also detailed in the effect that allows the save. Usually, a successful save means that a creature suffers no harm, or reduced harm, from an effect.</p>

		<h2>Skills</h2>
		<p>Each ability covers a broad range of capabilities, including skills that a character or a monster can be proficient in. A skill represents a specific aspect of an ability score, and an individual's proficiency in a skill demonstrates a focus on that aspect. (A character's starting skill proficiencies are determined at character creation, and a monster's skill proficiencies appear in the monster's stat block.)</p>
		<p>For example, a Dexterity check might reflect a character's attempt to pull off an acrobatic stunt, to palm an object, or to stay hidden. Each of these aspects of Dexterity has an associated skill: Acrobatics, Sleight of Hand, and Stealth, respectively. So a character who has proficiency in the Stealth skill is particularly good at Dexterity checks related to sneaking and hiding.</p>
		<p>The skills related to each ability score are shown in the following list. (No skills are related to Constitution.) See an ability's description in the later sections of this chapter for examples of how to use a skill associated with an ability.</p>

		<p>Sometimes, the <abbr title="Dungeon Master">DM</abbr> might ask for an ability check using a specific skill—for example, "Make a Wisdom (Perception) check." At other times, a player might ask the <abbr title="Dungeon Master">DM</abbr> if proficiency in a particular skill applies to a check. In either case, proficiency in a skill means an individual can add his or her proficiency bonus to ability checks that involve that skill. Without proficiency in the skill, the individual makes a normal ability check.</p>
		<p>For example, if a character attempts to climb up a dangerous cliff, the Dungeon Master might ask for a Strength (Athletics) check. If the character is proficient in Athletics, the character's proficiency bonus is added to the Strength check. If the character lacks that proficiency, he or she just makes a Strength check.</p>

		<aside>
			<h4>Variant: Skills with Different Abilities</h4>
			<p>Normally, your proficiency in a skill applies only to a specific kind of ability check. Proficiency in Athletics, for example, usually applies to Strength checks. In some situations, though, your proficiency might reasonably apply to a different kind of check. In such cases, the DM might ask for a check using an unusual combination of ability and skill, or you might ask your <abbr title="Dungeon Master">DM</abbr> if you can apply a proficiency to a different check. For example, if you have to swim from an offshore island to the mainland, your <abbr title="Dungeon Master">DM</abbr> might call for a Constitution check to see if you have the stamina to make it that far. In this case, your <abbr title="Dungeon Master">DM</abbr> might allow you to apply your proficiency in Athletics and ask for a Constitution (Athletics) check. So if you're proficient in Athletics, you apply your proficiency bonus to the Constitution check just as you would normally do for a Strength (Athletics) check.</p>
			<p>Similarly, when your dwarf fighter uses a display of raw strength to intimidate an enemy, your <abbr title="Dungeon Master">DM</abbr> might ask for a Strength (Intimidation) check, even though Intimidation is normally associated with Charisma.</p>

		<h2>Suffocating</h2>
		<p>A creature can hold its breath for a number of minutes equal to 1 + its Constitution modifier (minimum of 30 seconds).</p>
		<p>When a creature runs out of breath, it can survive for a number of rounds equal to its Constitution modifier (minimum 1 round). At the start of its next turn, it drops to 0 hit points and is dying.</p>
		<p>If you run out of breath, you can't regain hit points or be stabilized until you can breathe again.</p>
		<p>For example, a creature with a Constitution of 14 can hold its breath for 3 minutes. If it starts suffocating, it has 2 rounds to reach air before it drops to 0 hit points.</p>

	<hr class="section-break">

	<section id="using">
		<h2>Using Each Ability</h2>
		<p>Every task that a character or monster might attempt in the game is covered by one of the six abilities. This section explains in more detail what those abilities mean and the ways they are used in the game.</p>

		<hr/>

		<h3>Strength</h3>
		<p><dfn>Strength</dfn> measures bodily power, athletic training, and the extent to which you can exert raw physical force.</p>

		<h4>Strength Checks</h4>
		<p>A <dfn>Strength check</dfn> can model any attempt to lift, push, pull, or break something, to force your body through a space, or to otherwise apply brute force to a situation. The Athletics skill reflects aptitude in certain kinds of Strength checks.</p>

		<h5>Athletics</h5>
		<p>Your Strength (Athletics) check covers difficult situations you encounter while climbing, jumping, or swimming. Examples include the following activities:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>You attempt to climb a sheer or slippery cliff, avoid hazards while scaling a wall, or cling to a surface while something is trying to knock you off.</li>
			<li>You try to jump an unusually long distance or pull off a stunt mid jump.</li>
			<li>You struggle to swim or stay afloat in treacherous currents, storm-tossed waves, or areas of thick seaweed. Or another creature tries to push or pull you underwater or otherwise interfere with your swimming.</li>
		</ul>

		<h5>Other Strength Checks</h5>
		<p> The <abbr title="Dungeon Master">DM</abbr> might also call for a Strength check when you try to accomplish tasks like the following:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Force open a stuck, locked, or barred door</li>
			<li>Break free of bonds</li>
			<li>Push through a tunnel that is too small</li>
			<li>Hang on to a wagon while being dragged behind it</li>
			<li>Tip over a statue</li>
			<li>Keep a boulder from rolling</li>
		</ul>

		<h4>Attack Rolls and Damage</h4>
		<p>You add your Strength modifier to your attack roll and your damage roll when attacking with a melee weapon such as a mace, a battleaxe, or a javelin. You use melee weapons to make melee attacks in hand-to-hand combat, and some of them can be thrown to make a ranged attack.</p>

		<h4>Lifting and Carrying</h4>
		<p>Your Strength score determines the amount of weight you can bear. The following terms define what you can lift or carry.</p>
		<dl>
			<dt>Carrying Capacity</dt>
			<dd>Your <dfn>carrying capacity</dfn> is your Strength score multiplied by 15. This is the weight (in pounds) that you can carry, which is high enough that most characters don't usually have to worry about it.</dd>

			<dt>Push, Drag, or Lift</dt>
			<dd>You can <dfn>push, drag, or lift</dfn> a weight in pounds up to twice your carrying capacity (or 30 times your Strength score). While pushing or dragging weight in excess of your carrying capacity, your speed drops to 5 feet.</dd>

			<dt>Size and Strength</dt>
			<dd>Larger creatures can bear more weight, whereas Tiny creatures can carry less. For each size category above Medium, double the creature's carrying capacity and the amount it can push, drag, or lift. For a Tiny creature, halve these weights.</dd>
		</dl>

		<aside>
			<h5>Variant: Encumbrance</h5>
			<p>The rules for lifting and carrying are intentionally simple. Here is a variant if you are looking for more detailed rules for determining how a character is hindered by the weight of equipment. When you use this variant, ignore the Strength column of the Armor table in chapter 5.</p>
			<p>If you carry weight in excess of 5 times your Strength score, you are encumbered, which means your speed drops by 10 feet.</p>
			<p>If you carry weight in excess of 10 times your Strength score, up to your maximum carrying capacity, you are instead heavily encumbered, which means your speed drops by 20 feet and you have disadvantage on ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws that use Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution.</p>
		</aside>

		<hr/>

		<h3>Dexterity</h3>
		<p><dfn>Dexterity</dfn> measures agility, reflexes, and balance.</p>

		<h4>Dexterity Checks</h4>
		<p>A <dfn>Dexterity</dfn> check can model any attempt to move nimbly, quickly, or quietly, or to keep from falling on tricky footing. The Acrobatics, Sleight of Hand, and Stealth skills reflect aptitude in certain kinds of Dexterity checks.</p>

		<h5>Acrobatics</h5>
		<p>Your Dexterity (Acrobatics) check covers your attempt to stay on your feet in a tricky situation, such as when you're trying to run across a sheet of ice, balance on a tightrope, or stay upright on a rocking ship's deck. The DM might also call for a Dexterity (Acrobatics) check to see if you can perform acrobatic stunts, including dives, rolls, somersaults, and flips.</p>

		<h5>Sleight of Hand</h5>
		<p>Whenever you attempt an act of legerdemain or manual trickery, such as planting something on someone else or concealing an object on your person, make a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check. The <abbr title="Dungeon Master">DM</abbr> might also call for a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check to determine whether you can lift a coin purse off another person or slip something out of another person's pocket.</p>

		<h5>Stealth</h5>
		<p> Make a Dexterity (Stealth) check when you attempt to conceal yourself from enemies, slink past guards, slip away without being noticed, or sneak up on someone without being seen or heard.</p>

		<h5>Other Dexterity Checks</h5>
		<p>The <abbr title="Dungeon Master">DM</abbr> might call for a Dexterity check when you try to accomplish tasks like the following:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Control a heavily laden cart on a steep descent</li>
			<li>Steer a chariot around a tight turn</li>
			<li>Pick a lock</li>
			<li>Disable a trap</li>
			<li>Securely tie up a prisoner</li>
			<li>Wriggle free of bonds</li>
			<li>Play a stringed instrument</li>
			<li>Craft a small or detailed object</li>
		</ul>

		<h4>Attack Rolls and Damage</h4>
		<p>You add your Dexterity modifier to your attack roll and your damage roll when attacking with a ranged weapon, such as a sling or a longbow. You can also add your Dexterity modifier to your attack roll and your damage roll when attacking with a melee weapon that has the finesse property, such as a dagger or a rapier.</p>

		<h4>Armor Class</h4>
		<p>Depending on the armor you wear, you might add some or all of your Dexterity modifier to your Armor Class, as described in chapter 5.</p>

		<h4>Initiative</h4>
		<p>At the beginning of every combat, you roll initiative by making a Dexterity check. Initiative determines the order of creatures' turns in combat, as described in chapter 9.</p>

		<h4>Hiding</h4>
		<p>When you try to hide, make a Dexterity (Stealth) check. Until you are discovered or you stop hiding, that check's total is contested by the Wisdom (Perception) check of any creature that actively searches for signs of your presence.</p>
		<p>You can't hide from a creature that can see you, and if you make noise (such as shouting a warning or knocking over a vase), you give away your position. An invisible creature can't be seen, so it can always try to hide. Signs of its passage might still be noticed, however, and it still has to stay quiet.</p>
		<p>In combat, most creatures stay alert for signs of danger all around, so if you come out of hiding and approach a creature, it usually sees you. However, under certain circumstances, the Dungeon Master might allow you to stay hidden as you approach a creature that is distracted, allowing you to gain advantage on an attack before you are seen.</p>
		<p>The <abbr title="Dungeon Master">DM</abbr> decides when circumstances are appropriate for hiding. Also, the question isn't whether a creature can see you when you're hiding. The question is whether it can see you clearly.</p>

		<h5>Passive Perception.</h5>
		<p> When you hide, there's a chance someone will notice you even if they aren't searching. To determine whether such a creature notices you, the <abbr title="Dungeon Master">DM</abbr> compares your Dexterity (Stealth) check with that creature's passive Wisdom (Perception) score, which equals 10 + the creature's Wisdom modifier, as well as any other bonuses or penalties. If the creature has advantage, add 5. For disadvantage, subtract 5. For example, if a 1st-level character (with a proficiency bonus of +2) has a Wisdom of 15 (a +2 modifier) and a proficiency in Perception, he or she has a passive Wisdom (Perception) of 14.</p>

		<h5>What Can you See?</h5>
		<p>One of the main factors in determining whether you can find a hidden creature or object is how well you can see in an area, which might be lightly or heavily obscured, as explained in chapter 8.</p>

		<hr/>

		<h3>Constitution</h3>
		<p><dfn>Constitution</dfn> measures health, stamina, and vital force.</p>

		<h4>Constitution Checks</h4>
		<p>Constitution checks are uncommon, and no skills apply to Constitution checks, because the endurance this ability represents is largely passive rather than involving a specific effort on the part of a character or monster.</p>
		<p>A Constitution check can model your attempt to push beyond normal limits, however.</p>
		<p>The <abbr title="Dungeon Master">DM</abbr> might call for a Constitution check when you try to accomplish tasks like the following:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Hold your breath</li>
			<li>March or labor for hours without rest</li>
			<li>Go without sleep</li>
			<li>Survive without food or water</li>
			<li>Quaff an entire stein of ale in one go</li>
		</ul>

		<h4>Hit Points</h4>
		<p>Your Constitution modifier contributes to your hit points. Typically, you add your Constitution modifier to each Hit Die you roll for your hit points.</p>
		<p>If your Constitution modifier changes, your hit point maximum changes as well, as though you had the new modifier from 1st level. For example, if you raise your Constitution score when you reach 4th level and your Constitution modifier increases from +1 to +2, you adjust your hit point maximum as though the modifier had always been +2. So you add 3 hit points for your first three levels, and then roll your hit points for 4th level using your new modifier. Or if you're 7th level and some effect lowers your Constitution score so as to reduce your Constitution modifier by 1, your hit point maximum is reduced by 7.</p>

		<hr/>

		<h3>Intelligence</h3>
		<p><dfn>Intelligence</dfn> measures mental acuity, accuracy of recall, and the ability to reason.</p>

		<h4>Intelligence Checks</h4>
		<p>An Intelligence check comes into play when you need to draw on logic, education, memory, or deductive reasoning. The Arcana, History, Investigation, Nature, and Religion skills reflect aptitude in certain kinds of Intelligence checks.</p>

		<h5>Arcana</h5>
		<p>Your Intelligence (Arcana) check measures your ability to recall lore about spells, magic items, eldritch symbols, magical traditions, the planes of existence, and the inhabitants of those planes.</p>

		<h5>History</h5>
		<p>Your Intelligence (History) check measures your ability to recall lore about historical events, legendary people, ancient kingdoms, past disputes, recent wars, and lost civilizations.</p>

		<h5>Investigation</h5>
		<p>When you look around for clues and make deductions based on those clues, you make an Intelligence (Investigation) check. You might deduce the location of a hidden object, discern from the appearance of a wound what kind of weapon dealt it, or determine the weakest point in a tunnel that could cause it to collapse. Poring through ancient scrolls in search of a hidden fragment of knowledge might also call for an Intelligence (Investigation) check.</p>

		<h5>Nature</h5>
		<p> Your Intelligence (Nature) check measures your ability to recall lore about terrain, plants and animals, the weather, and natural cycles.</p>

		<h5>Religion</h5>
		<p>Your Intelligence (Religion) check measures your ability to recall lore about deities, rites and prayers, religious hierarchies, holy symbols, and the practices of secret cults.</p>

		<h5>Other Intelligence Checks</h5>
		<p>The <abbr title="Dungeon Master">DM</abbr> might call for an Intelligence check when you try to accomplish tasks like the following:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Communicate with a creature without using words</li>
			<li>Estimate the value of a precious item</li>
			<li>Pull together a disguise to pass as a city guard</li>
			<li>Forge a document</li>
			<li>Recall lore about a craft or trade</li>
			<li>Win a game of skill</li>
		</ul>

		<h4>Spellcasting Ability</h4>
		<p>Wizards use Intelligence as their spellcasting ability, which helps determine the saving throw <abbr title="Difficulty Classes">DCs</abbr> of spells they cast.</p>

		<hr/>

		<h3>Wisdom</h3>
		<p><dfn>Wisdom</dfn> reflects how attuned you are to the world around you and represents perceptiveness and intuition.</p>

		<h4>Wisdom Checks</h4>
		<p>A Wisdom check might reflect an effort to read body language, understand someone's feelings, notice things about the environment, or care for an injured person. The Animal Handling, Insight, Medicine, Perception, and Survival skills reflect aptitude in certain kinds of Wisdom checks.</p>

		<h5>Animal Handling</h5>
		<p>When there is any question whether you can calm down a domesticated animal, keep a mount from getting spooked, or intuit an animal's intentions, the <abbr title="Dungeon Master">DM</abbr> might call for a Wisdom (Animal Handling) check. You also make a Wisdom (Animal Handling) check to control your mount when you attempt a risky maneuver.</p>

		<h5>Insight</h5>
		<p>Your Wisdom (Insight) check decides whether you can determine the true intentions of a creature, such as when searching out a lie or predicting someone's next move. Doing so involves gleaning clues from body language, speech habits, and changes in mannerisms.</p>

		<h5>Medicine</h5>
		<p>A Wisdom (Medicine) check lets you try to stabilize a dying companion or diagnose an illness.</p>

		<h5>Perception</h5>
		<p>Your Wisdom (Perception) check lets you spot, hear, or otherwise detect the presence of something. It measures your general awareness of your surroundings and the keenness of your senses. For example, you might try to hear a conversation through a closed door, eavesdrop under an open window, or hear monsters moving stealthily in the forest. Or you might try to spot things that are obscured or easy to miss, whether they are orcs lying in ambush on a road, thugs hiding in the shadows of an alley, or candlelight under a closed secret door.</p>

		<h5>Survival</h5>
		<p>The <abbr title="Dungeon Master">DM</abbr> might ask you to make a Wisdom (Survival) check to follow tracks, hunt wild game, guide your group through frozen wastelands, identify signs that owlbears live nearby, predict the weather, or avoid quicksand and other natural hazards.</p>

		<h5>Other Wisdom Checks</h5>
		<p>The <abbr title="Dungeon Master">DM</abbr> might call for a Wisdom check when you try to accomplish tasks like the following:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Get a gut feeling about what course of action to follow</li>
			<li>Discern whether a seemingly dead or living creature is undead</li>
		</ul>

		<h4>Spellcasting Ability</h4>
		<p>Clerics, druids, and rangers use Wisdom as their spellcasting ability, which helps determine the saving throw <abbr title="Difficulty Classes">DCs</abbr> of spells they cast.</p>

		<h4>Finding a Hidden Object</h4>
		<p>When your character searches for a hidden object such as a secret door or a trap, the <abbr title="Dungeon Master">DM</abbr> typically asks you to make a Wisdom (Perception) check. Such a check can be used to find hidden details or other information and clues that you might otherwise overlook.</p>
		<p>In most cases, you need to describe where you are looking in order for the DM to determine your chance of success. For example, a key is hidden beneath a set of folded clothes in the top drawer of a bureau. If you tell the <abbr title="Dungeon Master">DM</abbr> that you pace around the room, looking at the walls and furniture for clues, you have no chance of finding the key, regardless of your Wisdom (Perception) check result. You would have to specify that you were opening the drawers or searching the bureau in order to have any chance of success.</p>

		<hr/>

		<h3>Charisma</h3>
		<p><dfn>Charisma</dfn> measures your ability to interact effectively with others. It includes such factors as confidence and eloquence, and it can represent a charming or commanding personality.</p>

		<h4>Charisma Checks</h4>
		<p>A Charisma check might arise when you try to influence or entertain others, when you try to make an impression or tell a convincing lie, or when you are navigating a tricky social situation. The Deception, Intimidation, Performance, and Persuasion skills reflect aptitude in certain kinds of Charisma checks.</p>

		<h5>Deception</h5>
		<p>Your Charisma (Deception) check determines whether you can convincingly hide the truth, either verbally or through your actions. This deception can encompass everything from misleading others through ambiguity to telling outright lies. Typical situations include trying to fast-talk a guard, con a merchant, earn money through gambling, pass yourself off in a disguise, dull someone's suspicions with false assurances, or maintain a straight face while telling a blatant lie.</p>

		<h5>Intimidation</h5>
		<p>When you attempt to influence someone through overt threats, hostile actions, and physical violence, the DM might ask you to make a Charisma (Intimidation) check. Examples include trying to pry information out of a prisoner, convincing street thugs to back down from a confrontation, or using the edge of a broken bottle to convince a sneering vizier to reconsider a decision.</p>

		<h5>Performance</h5>
		<p>Your Charisma (Performance) check determines how well you can delight an audience with music, dance, acting, storytelling, or some other form of entertainment.</p>

		<h5>Persuasion</h5>
		<p>When you attempt to influence someone or a group of people with tact, social graces, or good nature, the <abbr title="Dungeon Master">DM</abbr> might ask you to make a Charisma (Persuasion) check. Typically, you use persuasion when acting in good faith, to foster friendships, make cordial requests, or exhibit proper etiquette. Examples of persuading others include convincing a chamberlain to let your party see the king, negotiating peace between warring tribes, or inspiring a crowd of townsfolk.</p>

		<h5>Other Charisma Checks</h5>
		<p>The <abbr title="Dungeon Master">DM</abbr> might call for a Charisma check when you try to accomplish tasks like the following:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Find the best person to talk to for news, rumors, and gossip</li>
			<li>Blend into a crowd to get the sense of key topics of conversation</li>
		</ul>

		<h4>Spellcasting Ability</h4>
		<p>Bards, paladins, sorcerers, and warlocks use Charisma as their spellcasting ability, which helps determine the saving throw <abbr title="Difficulty Classes">DCs</abbr> of spells they cast.</p>

	<section id="vision">
		<h2>Vision and Light</h2>
		<p>The most fundamental tasks of adventuring—noticing danger, finding hidden objects, hitting an enemy in combat, and targeting a spell, to name just a few—rely heavily on a character's ability to see. Darkness and other effects that obscure vision can prove a significant hindrance.</p>
		<p>A given area might be lightly or heavily obscured.</p>
		<dl>
			<dt>Lightly Obscured</dt>
			<dd>In a <dfn>lightly obscured</dfn> area, such as dim light, patchy fog, or moderate foliage, creatures have disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.</dd>

			<dt>Heavily Obscured</dt>
			<dd>A <dfn>heavily obscured</dfn> area—such as darkness, opaque fog, or dense foliage—blocks vision entirely. A creature in a <dfn>heavily obscured</dfn> area effectively suffers from the blinded condition (see the appendix). A <dfn>heavily obscured</dfn> area doesn't blind you, but you are effectively blinded when you try to see something obscured by it.</dd>
		</dl>

		<p>The presence or absence of light in an environment creates three categories of illumination: bright light, dim light, and darkness.</p>
		<dl>
			<dt>Bright Light</dt>
			<dd><dfn>Bright light</dfn> lets most creatures see normally. Even gloomy days provide <dfn>bright light</dfn>, as do torches, lanterns, fires, and other sources of illumination within a specific radius.</dd>

			<dt>Dim Light</dt>
			<dd><dfn>Dim light</dfn>, also called shadows, creates a lightly obscured area. An area of <dfn>dim light</dfn> is usually a boundary between a source of bright light, such as a torch, and surrounding darkness. The soft light of twilight and dawn also counts as <dfn>dim light</dfn>. A particularly brilliant full moon might bathe the land in <dfn>dim light</dfn>.</dd>

			<dt>Darkness</dt>
			<dd><dfn>Darkness</dfn> creates a heavily obscured area. Characters face <dfn>darkness</dfn> outdoors at night (even most moonlit nights), within the confines of an unlit dungeon or a subterranean vault, or in an area of magical darkness.</dd>
		</dl>

		<p>In addition to the normal sight most creatures have, three special types of sight exist that have certain benefits or disadvantages in specific light levels.</p>
		<dl>
			<dt>Blindsight</dt>
			<dd>A creature with <dfn>blindsight</dfn> can perceive its surroundings without relying on sight, within a specific radius. Creatures without eyes, such as oozes, and creatures with echolocation or heightened senses, such as bats and true dragons, have this sense.</dd>

			<dt>Darkvision</dt>
			<dd>Many creatures in the worlds of D&amp;D, especially those that dwell underground, have <dfn>darkvision</dfn>. Within a specified range, the creature can see in dim light within 60 feet of them as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. However, the creature can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.</dd>

			<dt>Truesight</dt>
			<dd>A creature with <dfn>truesight</dfn> can, out to a specific range, see in normal and magical darkness, see invisible creatures and objects, automatically detect visual illusions and succeed on saving throws against them, and perceive the original form of a shapechanger or a creature that is transformed by magic. Furthermore, the creature can see into the Ethereal Plane.</dd>
